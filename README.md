Web application-event for integration into a business process and automation of a business process on the Bitrix.ru platform

This work was done for the purpose of an internship in the IT company art solution - a golden partner of bitrix24.

The application is a script for events in business processes, which can be built into any part of the block scheme of business processes.

Features:
1) When the script is triggered, a message should be sent by a bot (which the application also creates when installed on the platform) according to the parameters specified in this script from the interface.
2) Interface inside the web form, which allows you to configure items such as:
2.1 Message recipients
2.2 Message 
2.3 Global platform constants on a specific event in the business process (the event that triggered the event) to be passed in the message.
